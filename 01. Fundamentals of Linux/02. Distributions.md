## Linux distributions
Linux distributions (distros) are different versions of Linux that package the Linux kernel with various software, system utilities, and package managers.

Each distro is designed for different use cases, such as personal computing, server management, or security.

A: **Ubuntu** is based on **Debian** and uses **.deb packages with apt**. **CentOS** (replaced by AlmaLinux/Rocky) is based on **Red Hat** and uses **.rpm packages with yum/dnf**. CentOS/Alma is preferred for enterprise-grade systems, while Ubuntu is widely used for both desktops and servers.
