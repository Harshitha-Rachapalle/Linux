## Why Operating system?

* The physical component of a computer is a Hardware ( CPU, motherboard, memory , desk space etc)

users and software applications need to interact with computer & it is possible through operating system

operating system is  a software program that knows how to use the hardware and os basically performs
device management, process management, network management, memory management

OS is a bridge to communicate  between software & hardware . OS has a layer of CLI(linux) / GUI (windows) where users interact

## Linux
* It is a opensource , secure , stable, relaible

* The main component of linux is a **kernel**. It's like a **engine**

* **Linux distro** = car with engine, dashboard, wheels etc

+----------------------------------------------------+

| Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)                     |  <-- Part of the OS

| System Libraries (glibc, libc, OpenSSL, etc.)     |  <-- Part of the OS

| System Utilities (ls, grep, systemctl, etc.)      |  <-- Part of the OS

| Linux Kernel (Process, Memory, FS, Network)       |  <-- Core of the OS

| Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Peripherals)   |

(a) Hardware Layer

🔹 The physical components of the computer (CPU, RAM, disk, network interfaces, etc.).

🔹 The OS interacts with hardware using device drivers.

(b) Kernel (Core of Linux OS)

🔹 The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management – Schedules processes and handles multitasking.

    Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.

    Device Drivers – Acts as an interface between software and hardware.

    File System Management – Manages how data is stored and retrieved.

    Network Management – Handles communication between systems.

(c) Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)

🔹 A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.

🔹 Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.

🔹 Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.

(d) User Applications

🔹 End-user programs like web browsers, text editors, DevOps tools, etc.

🔹 Applications interact with the OS using system calls via the shell or GUI.
