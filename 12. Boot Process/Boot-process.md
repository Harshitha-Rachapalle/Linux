## Boot process & troubleshooting

### Step 1: BIOS/UEFI ‚Äì The First Gatekeeper

‚úÖ When the server powers on, the **BIOS/UEFI firmware performs a hardware check called POST** (Power-On Self-Test).

‚úÖ Checks CPU, RAM, disk, and connected peripherals.

‚úÖ If an issue is found (e.g., corrupted hardware or misconfigured boot order), it may throw boot errors. 

‚úÖ The firmware then hands control to the boot loader (GRUB).

checks BIOS settings and boot order using:

```
sudo dmidecode | less
```

### Step 2: GRUB (Boot Loader) ‚Äì Selecting the Right Kernel

‚úÖ GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is **responsible for loading the Linux kernel**. 

‚úÖ It presents a boot menu allowing selection of different kernel versions. 

‚úÖ If misconfigured, the system may hang at the GRUB prompt.

* manually edits GRUB to select an older working kernel:
  
  At the GRUB menu: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Press e to edit the boot entry.

   2Ô∏è‚É£ Locate the kernel line.

  3Ô∏è‚É£ Modify kernel parameters or try a previous version.

  4Ô∏è‚É£ Press Ctrl + X to boot.

If GRUB itself fails, reinstalls it manually using:
```
sudo grub-install /dev/sda
```

### Step 3: Kernel Initialization ‚Äì Loading Core System Components

Once GRUB hands over control, the Linux kernel boots up and initializes:

‚úÖ Hardware drivers (network, storage, peripherals).

‚úÖ Essential modules required for booting the operating system. 

‚úÖ The root filesystem (/), mounting disks.

checks for kernel panic errors using:
```
journalctl -k -b
```
If a kernel panic occurs, she boots into a previous working kernel using:
```
sudo grub-reboot "Previous Kernel"
```

### Step 4: initramfs ‚Äì Preparing the Root Filesystem

 ‚úÖ initramfs (initial RAM filesystem) loads essential drivers before fully mounting the disk.
 
 ‚úÖ If corrupted, the system might throw a "No root filesystem found" error.

to fix missing drivers we should rebuilds `initramfs` 
```
sudo update-initramfs -u -k $(uname -r)
```
### Step 5: systemd ‚Äì Bringing Up Services & The System

 ‚úÖ The first user-space process (systemd) starts running.
 
 ‚úÖ Loads all configured services (networking, logging, SSH).
 
 ‚úÖ If a service hangs, the boot process stalls.

üí° we can  checks failing services using:

```
systemctl list-units --failed
```
She disables problematic services to allow boot:

```
sudo systemctl disable failing-service
sudo reboot
```

### Step 6: User Login ‚Äì System Ready for Use

The boot completes, and users log into the system via SSH or GUI.

‚úÖ If login doesn‚Äôt work,i'll checks getty@.service. ‚úÖ If SSH fails, she restarts the SSH service:

```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
